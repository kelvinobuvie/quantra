# Financial Management App for Students: Case Study
## Problem Statement
Many students face challenges in managing their finances due to limited income, complex budgeting, and a lack of financial literacy. With various expenses such as tuition, books, food, and entertainment, it becomes easy to overspend, fall into debt, or neglect savings. Additionally, students often lack a clear understanding of how to track their spending, set financial goals, or protect their savings.

## Challenges:
Tight budgets and inconsistent income sources.
Difficulty tracking and categorizing spending.
Lack of tools for budgeting, saving, and avoiding debt.
Security concerns regarding sensitive financial data.
Limited financial literacy and planning skills.

## Solution Overview
To address these challenges, we built a Financial Management App aimed at helping students better track, manage, and plan their finances. The app provides tools for budgeting, monitoring spending, saving for goals, and improving financial literacy. It also includes key security features like safelocking funds for future use.

## Key Features:
**Dashboard Overview:** A simple, user-friendly interface that provides a snapshot of the user's financial health, including balances, expenses, and savings goals. <Br/>
**Transaction History & Reports:** A page that records transaction history, allowing users to categorize spending and analyze their financial behavior over time. <Br/>
**Visual Financial Charts:** Interactive visual representations (graphs/charts) showing how the user's finances are managed and where they are spending.<Br/>
**Safelock Feature:** A secure lock for funds that prevents users from accessing certain amounts of money until they need it, encouraging responsible savings and financial discipline.<Br/>
**Expense Categorization:** Automated categorization of transactions, helping users identify spending habits and areas where they can cut back.

## Technology Stack
The app was developed using the following technologies:

**React (Front-end):** For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.<br/>
**Express (API):** To handle server-side logic and API routes.<br/>
**SQL (Database):** For efficient storage and management of user data, transactions, and financial records.<br/>


## Design and Development Process
**1. Understanding User Needs**
We began by researching the pain points that students face when managing their finances. We conducted surveys and interviews to understand their struggles with budgeting, tracking expenses, and saving money. The feedback highlighted the need for a simple, easy-to-use tool that could provide visibility into spending habits and offer proactive savings features.

**2. Prototyping and Wireframing**
Using the insights gained, we created wireframes and prototypes of the app. We focused on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that the app's design was intuitive for students with limited financial knowledge.



**3. Development and Testing**
Once the design was finalized, we began development using React for the front-end, ensuring it was responsive and mobile-friendly. The Express API was built to handle secure data management, and SQL was used to store user transaction history and other financial data securely.

We ran multiple user testing sessions to validate the functionality and usability of the app. Feedback was incorporated into iterative versions of the app to ensure it met student needs.

## Challenges Faced
**During development, we encountered several challenges:**

**Security:** Ensuring that usersâ€™ financial data was protected, especially with features like safelocking funds.
**Scalability:** Handling large amounts of transaction data efficiently in the SQL database.
**User Experience:** Striking the right balance between simplicity and functionality, especially for students who may not have prior experience with financial apps.
